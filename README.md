# go_swagger_client
REST clients from swagger-2.0 specs

The swagger-go generator is from [VMWare](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger).

The swagger-specs used here are from:
[Westfield-core](https://api.westfield.io/swagger/1.json) and 
[Westfield-secure](https://secure.westfield.io/swagger/1.json)

The demo program using the generated REST-client code is **restclient.go**.
